# C++ Pong with ncurses library.
## Requirements
0. Linux (cause it uses ncurses, which is absent on Windows).
1. g++-10 compiler is needed because of c++20.
2. ncurses library should be installed on system.
## How to build
Just run make.
## Purpose of this project
Just educational for myself, to learn sockets (which is not implemented yet). And maybe some c++20 features(like span).
